  heroIntro:
    "A Victorian pub at the heart of Barkham — food, proper pints and community.",
  story: [
    "The Bull has welcomed locals for centuries. Housed in a Grade II‑listed building with a working inglenook and etched glass, it carries the warmth of a Tudor‑style inn.",
    "Once home to a smithy (1728–1982), the glow of the hearth still anchors the room where iron once sparked.",
    "Named for the medieval Bullock family who held Barkham Manor, our pub remains a place for food, proper pints and community — yesterday, today and tomorrow."
